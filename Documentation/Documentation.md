# Documentation

### What to put in this folder

This folder is for general documentation which does not fit into the code base,
e. g. project-wide documentation, development conventions etc.

For documenting code, prefer documentation comments directly in the code base,
like the following example:

```c#
/// <summary>
/// Does the thing. To do the thing, it requires that the other thing
/// has been done.
/// </summary>
public void DoTheThing()
{
    ...
}
```
